"""Local mirror of the public vulnerability feeds — Lybra's knowledge base.

This module is what lets Lybra answer "which CVEs affect this product at this
version?" from its own database, without reaching out to the network once per
scanned target. It mirrors three public feeds locally — NVD (the CVE catalogue),
CISA-KEV (vulnerabilities known to be exploited in the wild) and FIRST-EPSS
(exploitation-probability scores) — and knows how to compare software versions
against the ranges NVD publishes.

Everything lives in one file on purpose, grouped into three concerns:

Version logic
    ``version_compare`` and ``version_in_range`` are the correctness-critical
    heart of the matcher: they decide whether a discovered version falls inside
    the affected range NVD declares for a CVE.

CPE helpers
    ``normalize_cpe_to_23`` and ``parse_cpe23`` translate between the CPE string
    Nmap emits (the older 2.2 URI form) and the one NVD uses (the 2.3 form), and
    pull out the vendor/product/version we actually match on.

Ingest and fetch
    The ``ingest_*`` / ``parse_*`` functions turn a decoded feed record into a
    plain dict ready to persist; the ``fetch_*`` functions are the thin network
    edge that downloads the feeds over HTTP (with a small retry/backoff, mirroring
    the pattern already used by ``AegisAlertFetcher``).

The ingest and parse functions are deliberately pure — they take an
already-decoded record and return a dict — so they can be unit-tested with tiny
fixtures. Only the ``fetch_*`` functions touch the network.

def split_distro_version(version: str) -> Tuple[Optional[int], str, Optional[str]]:
    """Split a distribution package version into ``(epoch, upstream, revision)``.

    A distro package version is not the vendor's version: Debian and its
    derivatives write ``1:2.4.49-1ubuntu1``, where ``1:`` is the *epoch* (a
    counter the distribution bumps when it has to renumber downwards) and
    ``-1ubuntu1`` is the *revision* (which packaging of that same upstream
    release this is). Alpine writes ``2.4.49-r0``. Only the middle part —
    ``2.4.49`` — is the version the vendor released, and the only one NVD ever
    talks about.

    Both extras break comparison in *opposite* directions, which is why they
    have to come off before comparing rather than be tolerated:

    * The epoch is read as a leading component, so ``1:2.4.49`` compares as
      ``[1, 2, 4, 49]`` and lands *below* ``2.4.49``.
    * The revision is read as a trailing component, so ``2.4.49-1ubuntu1``
      compares *above* ``2.4.49`` and falls outside a range that ends there.

    Anything after a ``+`` is packaging or build metadata (``2.4.49+dfsg``,
    ``1.0.0+20130313144700``) and is dropped from the upstream part, following
    the same rule semver §10 states for build metadata: it never affects
    precedence.

        the comparator it is not looking at a distro version.

    are treated as equal. This is good enough for the dotted vendor versions the
    matcher sees; it is not a full PEP 440 / semver implementation.

    **Distro package versions are normalized first** (see
    :func:`split_distro_version`), because the matcher's two inputs are not the

    have them is a category error, and it broke in both directions at once —
    an epoch produced false positives by dragging the version down, a revision
    produced false negatives by pushing it past the top of a range.

    Two deliberate asymmetries, both following from that:

    * **Epochs count only when both sides have one.** Between two distro
      versions the epoch is the most significant component and is honoured.
      Against an NVD bound, which never carries one, it is dropped from both

    * **Revisions count only as a tiebreaker, and only when both sides have
      one.** ``2.4.49-1`` is older than ``2.4.49-2``, which matters when
      ordering packages among themselves; but ``2.4.49-1ubuntu1`` against the
