"""The detection core — turns discovered services into normalized findings.

Given the services found on a host, the engine produces :class:`Finding`-shaped
dicts: always an informational "this port is open" finding, and — when a CVE
lookup is wired in — one finding per known vulnerability that affects the
service's product and version.

Two design choices keep this module easy to reason about and to test:

* It is **ORM-free**. The engine works with plain :class:`Service` values and
  returns plain dicts; it never touches the database. The lookups it needs
  (CVE / KEV / EPSS) are passed in as callables, so a test can hand it fakes and
  a caller can hand it the real repository methods.
* The mapping from Nmap's data model into the engine's lives *here*, in
  :func:`services_from_discovered_ports`, rather than leaking into the manager.

The persistence, correlation and network phases all happen around the engine, in
the manager; the engine itself is a pure transformation from services to
findings.

       uses today is exactly what this feed is for.
    3. Look the same normalized name up in the automated index derived from
       the KB's own ``CpeMatch`` rows (``product_alias_lookup``) — reached
       only when the curated feed missed. This is what makes a desktop
       inventory resolvable at all: neither Nmap nor a hand-written table was
       ever going to cover it alone.

    Both 2 and 3 key off the *normalized* name, not the raw string — a
    desktop inventory entry routinely bakes the version into the name itself
    ("7-Zip 25.01"), which a raw-string table could never match reliably
    across versions.

    If none yields a concrete vendor, product and version, this returns
    ``None`` rather than inventing a CPE — a fabricated CPE that NVD does not
    know would silently match nothing.

    Args:
        service: The service to resolve.
        product_alias_lookup: See :class:`LybraEngine`'s constructor. Omitted
            (``None``) by any caller that has not wired the KB-backed index —
            strategy 3 is simply skipped, same as ``cve_lookup=None`` skips
            detection entirely.
        record_resolution: Callback ``(nombre_normalizado, origen, resuelto)``
            para llevar la cuenta de qué nombres de producto no se consiguen
            resolver. Se invoca **sólo** cuando el nombre y la versión
            existen y aun así ninguna estrategia dio con el CPE: eso es
            exactamente "falta un alias", que es lo que el ranking tiene que
            saber. Un servicio sin versión concreta o sin nombre no falla por
            falta de alias, así que contarlo ensuciaría la lista con trabajo
            que no existe.

            Inyectado en vez de escrito aquí porque este paquete es libre de
            ORM y debe seguir siéndolo (``test_lybra_package_invariants``).

    Returns:
        A ``(vendor, product, version, cpe_2_3)`` tuple, or ``None`` if the
        service cannot be resolved with confidence.
